This repository contains materials presented at a Grad Student Organization led "Best Practices and Workflow Workshop." 

Everything under the `presentation` folder is for the short presentation. Everything else is a part of the "live demo."

To compile the Rnw document to a pdf, you'll need to following tools installed:

* latex
* R
* make

To output the Rnw to a docx, you'll also need pandoc.

Finally, if you want to compile the presentation, you'll need the metropolis theme and the Adobe Source Code Pro fonts installed and in a place that xelatex can find them.
